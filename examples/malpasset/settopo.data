---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only the first mtopofiles+1 nonempty lines of this file are read by settopo

Each line has the form
  itopotype minlevel maxlevel t1 t2 fname

itopotype tells what format the data is in:
  itopotype = 1:  standard GIS format: 3 columns: lon,lat, z (meters)
                                            or      x, y,  z
  itopotype = 2:  Header as in DEM file, one z value per line
  itopotype = 3:  Header as in DEM file, one row of z values per line

Header format is:
xxxx      ncols
xxxx      nrows
xxxx     xllcorner
xxxx     yllcorner
xxxx     cellsize
xxxx     NODATA_value


z values are positive for topography, negative for bathymetry.

Values are ordered from upper left corner, moving east across each row 
(y fixed, x increasing) and then south (y decreasing).

The region covered by this file should be refined to at least minlevel
   and at most maxlevel over the time interval specified.

If a point is covered by several regions, the largest values of minlevel and
maxlevel from all such regions are used.

Refinement may also be forced or allowed by the minlevel and maxlevel
parameters for the regions specified in setregions.data or setmovetopo.data.

At points that lie far from shore (where h is greater than depthdeep),
refinement is only allowed to level maxleveldeep.  These parameters are set
in setgeo.data.

In setting topography in a computation, the finest topography available
will be used for each grid cell.  If a grid cells lies partially but
not entirely in a topo file then a coarser topo file will be used for
the remainder of the cell (with area-weighted averaging).

The order of topo files in the list above should not matter.
