---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If iqinit = 0 then no initial perturbation to depth is imposed in qinit

If iqinit > 1 then the next line has the form
  minlevel maxlevel  fname

An initial perturbation is read from file fname and imposed in qinit.
At the initial time minlevel and maxlevel are used for refinement in the
region covered by this perturbation.

The following values are allowed for iqinit:
    1: perturbation to depth, h.
    2: perturbation to momentum, hu.
    3: perturbation to momentum, hv.
    4: surface elevation eta is defined by the file and results in depth h=max(eta-b,0)

currently only supports one file type:
    x,y,z values, one per line in standard order from NW corner to SE
    z is perturbation to h,hu,hv, or is definition of eta.
