              malpasset.geo.txt: original scattered data topo file from Nicole Goutal
	      malpasset_cadam.xyz : same as above with header removed, and first column removed.
	                      ie: 3 columns: x,y,z.
              malpasset_mycoords.xyz : data above transformed to the coords I've been using


---------------------------------------
transformcadam.py


          The data given by the CADAM description (Goutal) is rotated and translated from the
	  topo data that I have tediously compiled. transformcadam.py transforms the CADAM (X,Y) data to the
	  set of axes I have been using.

          The transformation is as follows:
	  if the CADAM coordinates are denoted (X,Y,Z) and my coordinates are denoted (x,y,z) the 
	  transformation is as follows:

            |  0  1  0  |  |X| + Tx  = x
	    | -1  0  0  |  |Y| + Ty  = y
	    |  0  0  1  |  |Z| + Tz  = z

           or x = R*X + T, where

            Tx= 953595.0
            Ty= 1849222.0
	    Tz=0.
