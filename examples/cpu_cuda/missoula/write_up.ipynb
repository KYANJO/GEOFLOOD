    "### Malpasset dam break visualization on google earth using the Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS).\n",
    "\n",
    "The QGIS is a free and open source Geographic Information System (GIS) application that provides data viewing, editing, and analysis capabilities. It also supports a wide variety of raster, vector, and database formats and allows users to create new data formats through the use of \"plugins\". It is a very powerful tool for geospatial data processing and visualization. It can be used to visualize the dam break simulation results on google earth. The QGIS can be downloaded from the following [link](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically the idea is to export frame images at different timesteps from the simulation and georeference them using points that are recongoziable both in google earth and in the simulation domain (obtained from the lat-long converted topography files provided by David). Since we performed the simulation using David George's coordinate system, the generated frame images at specific time step is overlayed google earth using the snippet below from a .kml file\n",

    "We use the recongnizable initial reservior coordinates of the dam obtained from google earth and other points obtained from the figure above to obatin $(x,y)$ ground control points to georeference the simulated frame image using David George coordinates onto google earth. We also use the compuatational domain corresponding to the two  very narrow consecutive sharp bends immediate downstream of the dam on Reyran river valley that forms the flow path and recongnizable flow path of the flood region to obtain and match other ground control points. To transform the georeferenced points onto the map, we select the thin plate spline transformation type in QGIS georeference inorder to introduce local deformations in the data of the image and use a spline-based technique while interpolating and smoothing ground control points. see [QGIS documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/2.14/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins_georeferencer.html) for more information about georeferencing an image on a map. The georeferenced raster with the cooresponding coordinates is shown in the figure below.\n",

    "After generating the georefrenced Raster above, ground control points (GCP)(see the last cell for the file) are saved to be called and used for other frames, this makes the remaing work easy as the steps become so easy in the case that you only need the frame image, and GCP to overlay a specific frame on google earth using QGIS. After overlaying the image on the map, we obatin the following  figures for 0, 200, 1500, and 2400 seconds overlayed on Google Satellite Hybrid layer respectively.\n",

    "Because our image now contains uncompressed data, the file size is quite large. Using `JPEG` compression we can reduce the final map to a more manageble file size while still preserving the quality of the image. So we add the following lines to `gralwarp` command:\n",

Additionally, the `JPEG_QUALITY` is a value from 1 to 100 and lets you trade some image quality for compression ratio. \n",

    "- These options require a directory named TIFF to be created before running the command\n",

    "### Tiling\n",
    "One more optimization we can do to our image in this processing step is to add tiling to it. Enabling tiling will store the data in tiles (square blocks) rather than strips, which helps to speed up access to the file. We add tiling to the gdal commad with: `-co TILED=YES`"

These overviews can be added using the `gdaladdo` utility.
