# Notes on porting geoclaw to ForestClaw

# ------------------------------------------

Changes that are more than just name changes are designated with "FORESTCLAW"

1. Create directory fc2d_geoclaw.

1. Copy clawpack5 library files (fc2d_clawpack5.{cpp,h} to
   fc2d_geoclaw.{cpp,h}.   Change names accordingly.

2. Create directories geolib_source, amrlib_source, fortran_source,
   riemann_source
   -- geolib_source : all files from clawpack/geoclaw/src/2d/shallow
   -- amrlib_source : some files from clawpack/amrclaw/src/2d;
   -- fortran_source : additional files needed to interface with
      ForestClaw.
   -- Copy Riemann solvers (rpn2_geoclaw.f90, rpt2_geoclaw.f90,
      geoclaw_riemann_utils.f

3.  Change names of basic files : qinit.f90, setaux.f90, src2.f90,
    b4step2.f90, step2.f90, bc2.f90 to geoclaw_<name>.f90.  Names
    of subroutines also changed.

4.  Change names of Riemann solvers (rpn2 -> geoclaw_rpn2; rpt2 -> geoclaw_rpt2)

5.  geoclaw_step2.f : Added code to handle cubed-sphere (three corners)

6.  geoclaw_setaux.f : do not do optimzation that avoids extra copying, i.e.
    Skip this :
    !! ### parameter NEEDS_TO_BE_SET initialized in amr_module.f90
    !! ### saves time by otherwise copying instead of reinitializing
    #if 0
        IF (aux(1,ii,jj) .NE. NEEDS_TO_BE_SET) THEN
           skipcount = skipcount + 1
           CYCLE  ! new system copies bathy where possible
        ENDIF
    #endif

7.  Added 'types.h' file which contains definitions of F90 types used
    in GeoClaw.  These are useful for debugging in GDB.

8.  File 'geoclaw_tag4refinement.f90' replaces 'flag2refine.f90'.

# -----------------
# Questions
# -----------------

1.  Does GeoClaw use 'auxtype'?  It is allocated and assigned in amr2.f90, but I don't see it used.

2.  How do we handle the fact that AMR levels start at 1, and
    ForestClaw levels start at 0?  This comes up for xample, in setting
    regions.
