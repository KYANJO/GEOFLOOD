# GEOFLOOD
GeoFlood is a standalone application that uses the ForestClaw library and Riemann solvers designed by George (2008) in GeoClaw to solve SWE on a mapped, logically Cartesian grid. Aside from AMR in GeoFlood being supported by p4est, which allows grid refinement in only regions of interest, scales efficiency on large parallel platforms, uses a tree-based communication technique to minimize the amount of data needed to be transformed between processors, handles a wide range of geometric shapes, and can handle a variety of numerical solvers, GeoFlood has more features that distinguish it from GeoClaw. One
of them is its ability to run on multiple systems with either shared or distributed memory architectures. This is because the GeoClaw Riemann solvers in GeoFlood have been parallelized using Message Passing Interface (MPI), which in addition allows it to handle a broader range of problems than those parallelized in GeoClaw using Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP). GeoClawâ€™s use of OpenMP restricts it to running only on shared memory platforms. Another difference is that GeoFlood is designed to simulate overland
flooding issues, whereas GeoClaw is traditionally used for tsunami modeling
