# GEOFLOOD
GeoFlood is a stand-alone version model linked to ForestClaw library. Basically, it simulates floods. As a test, we have Bowl_radial from GeoClaw. As time goes on, we will implement our own flood problems with runoff capabilities. In addition to handling wet/dry fonts, these problems will also handle a variety of other things.
