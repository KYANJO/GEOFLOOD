# GEOFLOOD
The code GeoFlood is a new distributed parallel adaptive computational model for overland flows based on shallow water equations on mapped logically Cartesian adaptive meshes.
The model is written in C, C++, CUDA, Fortran and uses the ForestClaw library. The Code has both a CPU and GPU parallelised version, which a user can switch between using a flag in the setrun.py file.
